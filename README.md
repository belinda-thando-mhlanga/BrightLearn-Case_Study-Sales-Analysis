# 📘 Project Overview: BrightLearn-Case_Study-Sales-Analysis
You have been provided with a generic, simulated dataset “Sales Case Study.csv”,
which indicates the daily trading information for a large retail store, aggregated for the
day. The data is only for one of the products sold at this store.
Each record contains the:
- Date = The day on which the sales occurred
- Sales = Total Rand value of the sales that occurred
- Cost of Sales = Total Rand value of the cost of sales that occurred
- Quantity Sold = Total number of units that have been sold

# 🎯 Objectives: 
The main objectives of this analysis will provide an understanding to the following questions:
1. Daily sales price per unit
2. Average unit sales price
3. Daily % gross profit
4. Daily % gross profit per unit
5. Price elasticity of demand for 3 promotional periods
6. Additional insights and metrics

 #   📊 Formulars sheet used
**Metric - Formula**

- **Price per Unit:** Sales ÷ Quantity  
- **Gross Profit:** Sales – Cost  
- **Gross Profit Percentage:** ((Sales - Cost) / Sales) × 100%  
- **Change:** ((New - Old) / Old) × 100%  
- **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED):** (% Change in Quantity) / (% Change in Price)

**PED INSIGHT LOGIC
- If PED < -1 AND profit is positive:
"This product performs BETTER when sold at promotional prices. The product is price-elastic (PED = [your number]), meaning demand increases significantly when prices are lowered."

- If PED < -1 BUT profit is negative:
"The product is price-elastic (PED = [your number]), but current promotional prices are TOO LOW. We're selling below cost. With better pricing (e.g., R33.50 instead of R31), promotions would be profitable."

- If PED > -1:
"This product performs WORSE at promotional prices. The product is price-inelastic (PED = [your number]), meaning demand doesn't increase much when prices drop."
